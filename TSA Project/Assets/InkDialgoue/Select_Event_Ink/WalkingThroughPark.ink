//how to I print a variable in INK
"Let's go to the nearby park"
{game==1:
    "The weather is perfect," I say as the sun shines down
    Birds chirp and flowers bloom on the ground
    "What a nice walk!" roommate says
  - else:
    It suddenly starts pouring
    "Oh no! We're getting soaked!" I exclaim.
    "Ew a bird pooped on you!" roommate says.
    This is the worst walk ever!
